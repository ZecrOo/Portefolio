                        <p>Plantasia was our 3rd project answer which was a project that revolved around coming up with a new good idea and then marketing it and making statistics and future plans for economy and growth via commercialising it and selling it. This project was very different from other projects because it had another approach which was marketing and economy heavy which made it different to deal with but also teached us new values when it came to what a good idea needs to make it on the market.
                                <br><br>
                            This project was also special because our team actually also managed to win an award for "best idea" at our school between the many groups of the 3 design classes.
                                <br><br>
                            My job in this project was primarily marketing, some economy and then coding the blogs part of our website, which can be seen here. I made use of a lot of visual effects like hover and such to make it way more user friendly too.</p>
