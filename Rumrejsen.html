                        <p>International Space Travels or as the general project was called "Rumrejsen", was our first assigned project on the education where the requirements were to come up with a new evolutionary way to market space travel towards a desired group of people and then make as good of a website we could with the very basic coding knowledge we had gained at that point, and then also make a poster with eye-catcher properties so that you could commercial your idea that way.
                                <br><br>
                            I was in charge of the Photoshopped poster that you see to the left where I worked a lot with blending and other light options to make the ship blend as well in with the background as possible.
                                <br><br>
                            The other thing I was in charge of was the front page on the website which is the one you can see beneath the poster. I tried to design the page with the feeling of space in mind and think I did a pretty good job at just that considering my limited knowledge of coding at the time.</p>
